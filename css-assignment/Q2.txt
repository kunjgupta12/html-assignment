Q2) Explain the difference between absolute and relative positions.

Both absolute and relative positioning are part of CSS positioning.
Property	Description
relative	Positions the element relative to its normal position. Other elements are not affected.
absolute	Positions the element relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (other than static). If no such ancestor exists, it positions relative to the <html> element. The element is removed from the document flow.
