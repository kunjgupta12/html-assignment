Q1) What is the use of the float property? Which property is the better alternative to it?

    The float property in CSS is used to position elements to the left or 
    right of a container, allowing text or inline elements to wrap around them.
    It was widely used for layouts before Flexbox and CSS Grid became popular.

Alternatives to float property:

    Flexbox (display: flex;) – Better for aligning items in a row or column.
    CSS Grid (display: grid;) – Ideal for complex layouts.
    position: absolute or position: fixed – Sometimes used for specific layout requirements.
