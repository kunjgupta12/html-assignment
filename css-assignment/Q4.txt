Difference Between Inline and Block Elements in HTML


1. Block Elements
ðŸ”¹ Block elements take up the full width available, stretching from left to right.  
ðŸ”¹ They always starton a new line and push the next element down.  
ðŸ”¹ You can set `width`, `height`, `margin`, and `padding` on them.  
ðŸ”¹ Block elements are typically used for structuring content.
Examples of Block Elements:
<div> â€“ Generic container for block content  
<p> â€“ Paragraph  
<h1> to <h6> â€“ Headings  
<section> â€“ Defines sections in a page  
<article>â€“ Represents self-contained content  
<header> <nav> â€“ Structural elements


2. Inline Elements
ðŸ”¹ Inline elements only take up as much width as necessary.  
ðŸ”¹ They do not start on a new line butstay within the same line.  
ðŸ”¹ You canno set `width` and `height` (but can apply `padding` and `margin` in limited ways).  
ðŸ”¹ Inline elements are used for styling small parts of text or inline content.

Examples of Inline Elements:
<span>â€“ Generic inline container  
<a> â€“ Links  
<strong> â€“ Bold text  
<em> â€“ Italicized text  
<img>â€“ Inline image  
<code>â€“ Inline code formatting  

Eample of an Inline Element:
