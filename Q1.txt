What is HTML, and how is an HTML document structured?


HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It provides the basic structure of a webpage by using a system of elements and tags to define content such as text, images, links, and multimedia.


Structure

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML document.</p>
    <a href="https://example.com">Click here</a>
</body>
</html>

Explaination:

<!DOCTYPE html> → Declares the document type as HTML5.
<html> → The root element that encloses all content.
<head> → Contains metadata (info about the page, not displayed).

    <meta charset="UTF-8"> → Defines character encoding.
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> → Ensures responsive design.
    <title> → Sets the title of the webpage (shown in the browser tab).

<body> → Holds all the visible content of the webpage.

        <h1> → A heading (largest).
        <p> → A paragraph.
        <a href="URL"> → A hyperlink.
