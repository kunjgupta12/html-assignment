Q5)Why do we use meta tags?
Meta tags are used in HTML to provide metadata about a web page. They are placed within the <head> section of an HTML document and help search engines, browsers, and social media platforms understand the page’s content.
Common Uses of Meta Tags:

    SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
        Helps search engines understand the page’s content and rank it properly.
        Example:

    <meta name="description" content="Learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.">

Character Encoding

    Ensures proper text rendering and avoids character corruption.
    Example:

    <meta charset="UTF-8">

Responsive Design

    Controls how a webpage scales on different devices.
    Example:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
