Q)What is semantic HTML? List some semantic and non-semantic elements.
Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML tags that have meaningful names, which describe the content they contain or their purpose. These elements make the structure of a web page more understandable to both developers and browsers, enhancing accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and the general maintainability of the code.
Semantic HTML Elements:

    <header>: Represents the header of a page or section, often containing navigation or introductory content.
    <nav>: Defines a section for navigation links.
    <article>: Represents a standalone piece of content, like a blog post or a news article.
    <section>: Represents a thematic grouping of content, often with a heading.
    <aside>: Defines content that's tangentially related to the content around it (like a sidebar).
    <footer>: Represents the footer of a page or section, typically containing copyright info or links.
    <main>: Represents the main content of the document, distinct from headers, footers, and sidebars.
    <figure>: Represents a piece of content (like an image or a chart) with a caption.
    <figcaption>: Provides a caption for a <figure> element.
    <mark>: Highlights text that has special importance or relevance (often used for search results).

Non-Semantic HTML Elements:

    <div>: A generic container with no inherent meaning, used for grouping content.
    <span>: A generic inline container, useful for styling or grouping small sections of text.
    <b>: Makes text bold without implying any importance (compared to <strong>).
    <i>: Makes text italicized without suggesting emphasis (compared to <em>).
