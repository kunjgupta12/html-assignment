Q6)What are IDs and classes in HTML, and how do they differ?

Both IDs and classes are used to assign styles and behaviors to HTML elements, but they serve different purposes.
1. ID (#)

    A unique identifier for a single HTML element.
    Cannot be used for multiple elements on the same page.
    Used for JavaScript manipulation and specific styling.
    Declared using the id attribute in HTML.
    Accessed in CSS using #id-name.

Example:

<p id="unique-paragraph">This is a unique paragraph.</p>



Usage:

When an element must have a unique identifier.
Useful for JavaScript (document.getElementById("unique-paragraph")).


2. Class (.)

    A reusable style or behavior that can be applied to multiple elements.
    Used for grouping elements with similar styling.
    Declared using the class attribute in HTML.
    Accessed in CSS using .class-name.

Example:

<p class="highlight">This is a highlighted paragraph.</p>
<p class="highlight">This is another highlighted paragraph.</p>



Usage:

 When multiple elements share the same style.
Useful for applying styles consistently.
Can be used in JavaScript (document.getElementsByClassName("highlight")).
